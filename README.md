###Microbiota on Human Health Ontology (Micronto)

#Overview
The Microbiota on Human Health Ontology, or Micronto, is a semantic representation of the relationships between various elements related to the microbiota and its impact on human health. This ontology is designed to provide a structured and standardized framework for capturing knowledge about the intricate interplay between microbial communities and human well-being.
